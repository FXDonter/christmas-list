<main> <div class="intro"> <p> Hello to anyone who views this! I'm very exited for Christmas even though thanksgiving has not
even passed yet lol. As of writting this (nov 13 2024, 7:42) I'm very exited to code this website. I'm currently
listening to "Ecce Homo" and unreleased album by the band Weezer. Last week and this week I've been learning css
styling, filters, and animations. It's a tad bit confusing not going to lie, but very rewarding when done correctly. Anyways, sorry
to bore you with this. Now, we're getting to the main point of this website, the holiday wish list! You're either exited to
see the code, or dreading what I ask for if you're my parents lol.<p> </div> </main>
